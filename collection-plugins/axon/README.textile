h1. Axon Plugin for Spring Insight

This plugin supports Axon 1.x versions as well as the 2.0 version that's under development at the time of
writing.

It creates @Operation@ instances for @CommandBus#dispatch@,
@EventBus#publish@, @Saga#handle@ and event and command handler methods (both
annotated methods and interface-based implementations are matched). In
addition to that, there are @EndPointAnalyzer@ implementations for the handler
methods: a simple one for sagas, and two for command and event handlers that
check that the handle invocations take place in the context of their
corresponding bus. Command and event types are captured, as well as additional
metadata where available.

Here's an example of a trace containing Axon frames: !https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-insight-plugins/raw/master/collection-plugins/axon/screenshot.png!
